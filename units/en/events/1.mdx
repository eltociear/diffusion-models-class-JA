# Diffusion Models Live Event 

To go with the course's release, we are organising a **live community event on November 30th 2022** to which you are invited! The program includes exciting talks from the creators of Stable Diffusion, researchers at Stability AI and Meta, and more!

The talks will focus on a high-level presentation of diffusion models and the tools we can use to build applications with them.

**Collective Intelligence and Creative AI** by **David Ha**
David Ha is the Head of Strategy at Stability AI. He previously worked as a Research Scientist at Google, working in the Brain team in Japan. His research interests include complex systems, self-organization, and creative applications of machine learning. Prior to joining Google, He worked at Goldman Sachs as a Managing Director, where he co-ran the fixed-income trading business in Japan. He obtained undergraduate and masters degrees from the University of Toronto, and a PhD from the University of Tokyo.

**Beyond Text - Giving Stable Diffusion New Abilities** by **Justin Pinkney**
Justin is a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Lambda Labs working on image generation and editing, particularly for artistic and creative applications. He loves to play and tweak pre-trained models to add new capabilities to them, and is probably best known for models like: Toonify, Stable Diffusion Image Variations, and Text-to-Pokemon.

**Diffusion Models are Cool - But What Comes After the Hype?** by **Apolinário Passos**
Apolinário Passos is a Machine Learning Art Engineer at Hugging Face and an artist who focuses on generative art and generative media. He founded the platform multimodal.art and the corresponding Twitter account, and works on the organization, aggregation, and platformization of open-source generative media machine learning models.

**Stable Diffusion & Friends: High-Resolution Image Synthesis via Two-Stage Generative Models** by **Robin Rombach**
Robin is a research scientist at Stability AI. After studying physics at the University of Heidelberg from 2013-2020, he started a PhD in computer science in the Computer Vision group in Heidelberg in 2020 under the supervision of Björn Ommer and moved to LMU Munich with the research group in 2021. His research focuses on generative deep learning models, in particular text-to-image systems. During his PhD, Robin was instrumental in the development and publication of several now widely used projects, such as VQGAN and Taming Transformers, and Latent Diffusion Models. In collaboration with Stability AI, Robin scaled the latent diffusion approach and published a series of models now known as Stable Diffusion, which have been widely adapted by the community.
